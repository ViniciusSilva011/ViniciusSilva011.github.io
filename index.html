            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>

               I was born on 18 December 1999 in Brazil, and I came to Portugal in 2016. The cultural difference in the
               beginning was hard to get used to, but nowadays it is something that I don‚Äôt worry about. The best part
               of my work, and for which I am grateful, is the opportunity to learn and implement new technologies that
               solve several problems. A great example is when we had to synchronize data between different systems. I
               knew nothing about data synchronization, but my team gave me time and help to let me implement a system
               that uses the worlds of Apache Kafka, Laravel, and Node.js.
               <br />
               <!-- saying a lot meaning too little -->
               Everything was going great, but there is only one thing that doesn‚Äôt make feel good, and it is the fact
               that the Covet Group is not a company that has its focus on SaaS. This leads to an environment where I
               don‚Äôt have engineers to help me solve or discuss complex problems, I have no one where I can discuss
               technologies freely with other people, and the biggest problem is that I‚Äôm the only one with knowledge to
               help the programmers and improve theirs skills. At the moment, I don‚Äôt want to be fixing programmers‚Äô
               bugs all the time because of their lack of knowledge in reading the documentation. Sometimes helping
               programmers is wholesome, but making it my primary job is not something I want now.

               <!-- I can see the difference of
               my work in the daily-basis work of people's lives. Cases like work of people that usually would take fifteen minutes, 
               fifty hours or even a week to be done, with technology this could be reduced for less than half of the time.
               And when it comes to a long term period, the time that is being saved is a lot!!  -->

                  <p>
                  <ul>

                     <li>Here I learned all basics of programming such as OOP, algorithms, Big O notation, and
                        Pseudocode. These are the ones that I still remember while I am writing this (2021/1/16).</li>
                     <li>
                        In the beginning, we were strongly put into C-like programming languages to solve problems.
                        Languages like C, C++, C#,
                        and PHP were the ones where we solved plenty of exercises (from twenty to forty for each one).
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        For front-end development,
                        they introduced us to the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. For JS frameworks, we got in touch with
                        Angular.
                        Yes, it is insane! They just threw the hardest JS framework on students that barely knew how to
                        wrap HTML, CSS, and JS together.
                        But we got through it, this time what matters the most is the grades.
                        After their classes about JS, I ended up wanting to never touch again it.
                        With some experience, life hit me in the face and showed me I was wrong about JS.
                        I realized it could make my work a hundred thousand times easier by building dynamic pages.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        They introduced us to frameworks like Laravel and .NET. In the .NET framework, we solved some
                        exercises using Windows Forms, Console App, Xamarin,
                        Xamarin Forms and built some sites with ASP.NET web forms. The ‚ÄúASP.NET web forms‚Äù was the worst
                        technology that I learnt there.
                        That technology was so weird that today and also probably in the future I will still have some
                        aversion to it.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        They had a powerful side in .NET.
                        Today I still have the feeling of the director saying: ‚Äú.NET is the way to go! There‚Äôs nothing
                        that can be compared with it!‚Äù.
                        Every time that he was saying this we tried not to laugh. That time was outstanding. Director,
                        if you are reading this, I wish you the best üòÅ.
                     </li>
                     <li>

                        The most relevant part of the course was when the final project came.
                        I dare to say that around 40% of the course was focused on it.
                        My project was about to fetch all professors‚Äô schedules of some class that was written in
                        several
                        Excel files, merge all the information, and generate a new schedule for the entire class
                        dynamically.
                        I led the team by choosing the MVC pattern using the .NET Core 2.0 technology.
                        I told them that would be no way that I would program in ASP.NET web forms.
                        I showed them the whats and whys of choosing .NET Core 2.0 over web forms would be better.
                        In the end, they agreed to learn .NET Core from scratch with my help, and we started.
                        Aside from all hardships we went through programming, it was approximately 6 months of designing
                        database structures,
                        use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, classes diagrams, and of course, typing a lot of code.
                        In a nutshell, learning to plan and program all the logic and put it to reality was a hard task,
                        interacting and deciding with the team what would be the next step was interesting and helpful.
                        When we sent the project, it was around seventy percent completed and the final project was not
                        perfect, but in that time it was enough.

                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        It all started with the internship that I got into when I was about to finish the CTeSP program.
                        My internship project was about providing a user-friendly interface to manage and create
                        processes for several internal procedures.
                        In the beginning, I knew nothing about the company technologies and was through this project I
                        learned Vue.js, Laravel, and MySQL.
                        <i> <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/D2GpvZzwGSg">Preview</a></i>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        I also worked on some tasks related to data that should update in real-time.
                        For this case, the technologies that I used were mainly Socket.io and Redis.
                        Some projects that I worked on were needed to maintain the users updated with each other,
                        but there are mainly two projects that are exceptional.
                        <br>
                        The first one was about to send users notifications of their actions through the application
                        system,
                        seeing the two hundred people being notified through their actions was an interesting event to
                        see.
                        <br>
                        The second one helped me to maintain the users updated about the stock of a warehouse when the
                        products
                        would leave or enter it.
                     </li>
                     <li>I also changed the architecture of some parts of their Laravel project from standard Laravel
                        MVC to Vue.js MVVM.</li>
                     <li>
                        When it comes to the database, I always try to make the tables as normalized as I can.
                        There is always the case when the normalization can't be applied to the existing tables, but
                        in this case I can do nothing.
                     </li>
                     <!-- here -->
                     <li>
                        When I am doing a project I always try to let the pages be in the most responsive way possible,
                        so they can be used on other devices.
                        My designing skills are not cutting edge but I think I can get by on my own.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Nowadays, besides deploying apps using docker and maintaining their website,
                        I usually am doing tests to implement new features and thinking all the time about how to make
                        my code as clean as possible for the rest of the team.

                           I also chose Node.js to be the technology of intern programmers, because JS can serve as a
                           front and back end language.
                           If they learn that, then they can be more productive.

                           Vue.js is the front-end JavaScript framework that I have more practice with.
                           The concepts that I do not have total domain is about render functions and some JSX functions
                           to increase Vue performance, the rest is pretty well consolidated.

                        <li>
                           I also used Vue.js frameworks as Vuetify, bootstrap-vue, element-ui and so on...

                           I am also making good use of the docker-compose for wrapping everything.
                           When I learned how to use it I changed all my applications workflow to a container and
                           started working from there.

                              I am building a project that uses this technology to sync database data between different
                              systems.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              The part that I had more hardships with was securing all the configurations when using
                              SASL_SSL.
                              Configuring PLAIN_SSL was easy, but when testing the flavors of SASL was the problem.

                              Relatively to the SASL_SSL I had the feeling of the documentation was not being clear and
                              I was always making mistakes and not progressing.

                           <li>To use Apache Kafka is easy, but securing it is hard as hell</li>
                           <li>
                              I have one project that is completed using this tool. The other is work in progress, but
                              this one
                              aims to sync data between salesforce and their database tables</li>
